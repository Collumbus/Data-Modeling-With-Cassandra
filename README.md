# Data-Modeling-With-Cassandra
It is a project where I applied concepts data modelling with Apache Cassandra and built an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project has been defined a data model by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries. I am provided with part of the ETL pipeline that transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables.
